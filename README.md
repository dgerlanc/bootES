## Overview

bootES ("bootstrap Effect Sizes") uses the 'boot' package to find bootstrap
confidence intervals for unstandardized and standardized effect-size measures
appropriate for experimental and survey research. These include effect sizes for
mean effects, mean differences, contrasts, correlations, and differences between
correlations.

A pre-print version of our article, _bootES:_ An R Package for Bootstrap
Confidence Intervals on Effect Sizes, is available [here](https://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kirby/bootes-kirby-gerlanc-in-press.pdf).
